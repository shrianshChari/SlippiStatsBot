### Image files for SlippiStatsBot
- These images were made in GIMP
- I have included the original XCF files in case you think that they can be improved. If you choose to do so, export the new design under the name `<SlippiStats/SlippiStats_NoSlippiLogo>_new.png`, so that they can be easily compared with the original design.
