# SlippiStatsBot
A Discord bot dedicated to analysis of Project Slippi SLP replay files on Discord.

### TODO
- [  ] Implement SLP replay analysis (should activate upon the bot being mentioned)
- [  ] Create an about command that describes information about the bot
- [  ] Add license
- [  ] Potentially implement userinfo command (?)
- [  ] Finish this readme file with contact information, command information, table of contents

### Development
- `git clone` this repository and navigate into it
- `npm install`
